## User Experience

### Ideal User

- The ideal user can be any user who needs a bit of entertaining or wants to play a quick game.
- Can be used to help users between picking who's suggestion will be implemented to life. An Example, who will be a winner choces the option to apply.

### What users can expect

- Users can expect intuative navigation
- Visual design with activities and to meet their expectations.
- Properly working game.

### As developers, I'd expect

- The website works fast and smooth on different screens, phones, tablets, laptops and provides to our clients positive experience when they interact with our website.
- More users start to use the site.
- User protection and security. Users that visit the site feel secured.
- Site meets users expectation.

# Planning and design

### Colour palette

- In the project were used mainly 5 colours : Pink, LightViolet, White, Sky blue and Deep Sea Blue. ![Palette](https://i.ibb.co/KwkZKMB/color-palette.png" alt="color-palette)

I decided to use easy for eyes palette with soft colors. However, during the coding process I realised that some colors must be more intuitive for users in case to highligh something or not to be confused. An example was hands that used in the game. I believe that hands must have more contract and easier for eyest to understand where is computer and where is user. So Hand for user was picked green to make it more obvious and intuitive to understand.

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq wireframes software to build a simple framework that would help me to imagine how the web page should look like

Below is attached wireframe :

# Features

### Existing Features

The web page has a simple and intuitive design. The page allows user to play a game Rock, Scissors, Paper, Lizard and Spock. User can see two hands that interact with computer and player choices.
After picking the button of choice, JS displays user's options and computer option.
In addition it shows result and adds scores to the winner.

### Future improvements left to implement

- The current project has other options tor development.
- It could be an interestin idea to add orher pages with simple and easy games.
- I would like to add more animation to the page if I would have more time.

There are icons that were taken from source listed below. In addition to that I used sources to learn more about javaScript:

# Code

This was my first experience of coding in JavaScript on my own. I found this project quite interesting but challenging. It required a lot of information to re-read, re-watch, and to be practiced before implemented. This project required from me to search for additional sources, codes and and rewatch some videos for multiple times.
I know now the principle but I have to practice much more and continue learning.

# Acknowledgement

In this chapter I would like to express my gratitude to Code Institute for providing essentialand detailed information about JavaScript materials. It was very helpful when I could learn and peactice. Also, Thank you very much Stefania Frustagli who inspired me and supported me during the time I was writing the code.
