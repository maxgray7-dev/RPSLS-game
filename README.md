## User Experience

### Ideal User

- The ideal user can be any user who needs a bit of entertaining or wants to play a quick game. 
- Can be used to help users between picking who's suggestion will be implemented to life. An Example, who will be a winner choces the option to apply.

### What users can expect

- Users can expect intuative navigation
- Visual design with activities and to meet their expectations.
- Properly working game.

### As developers,  I'd expect

- The website works fast and smooth on different screens, phones, tablets, laptops and provides to our clients positive experience when they interact with our website.
- More users start to use the site.
- User protection and security. Users that visit the site feel secured.
- Site meets users expectation.

# Planning and design

### Colour palette

- In the project were used mainly four colours : Navy, White, Gray and Yellow. ![Palette](link for picture)

I decided to use easy for eyes palette with soft colors. However, during the coding process I realised that some colors must be more intuitive for users in case to highligh something or not to be confused. An example was hands that used in the game. I believe that hands must have more contract and easier for eyest to understand where is computer and where is user. So Hand for user was picked green to make it more obvious and intuitive to understand.

### Wireframes

For better visual support, I used the Balsamiq wireframe software to build a simple framework that would help me to imagine how this site look like.

 Below are attached wireframes :

# Code

This is my first experience in coding my own webpage. This was a challenging project but also very interesting with a lot of new approaches to learn. During work on this project I learned how to use HTML and CSS computer languages. To complete this peoject I got support from Code Institute, and used Love Running Project to guide me in some questions.
Nevertheless, in the moments when I faced difficulties and tried to find right answers I felt great support that was shown to me by my mentor Chris Quinn. You have my big gratitude for your support and wise support how  Ican improve mu code.

# Acknowledgement

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentor - Chris Quinn, who supported me during this project. He helped me with suggestions, feedback and answering incredible difficult to me questions. He made my work much less stressful and helped me to believe in my capabilities.
Additionally I would like to thank Code Institute for providing great learning material, that helped me to complete the project and gave opportunity to practice and implement gathered skills on practice.
Also I would like to express massive gratitude to the team od students that I met during my first Hackaton: Craig Thomasson, Stefania Frustagli, Nick Moore. Espe
